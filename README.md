# DeFi Script: Uniswap ü§ù Aave Integration

## Overview of Script

This script demonstrates the integration of two prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap V3 and Aave, on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. The script is designed to perform the following operations:

1. **Token Swap on Uniswap V3**:
   - The user initiates the script to swap USDC for LINK on Uniswap.
   - The script checks the user‚Äôs USDC balance and approves the Uniswap Swap Router to spend the required amount of USDC.
   - It retrieves pool information from Uniswap, prepares the necessary parameters, and executes the swap, converting USDC to LINK.
   - The received LINK tokens are transferred to the user's wallet.

2. **Supply LINK on Aave**:
   - After successfully swapping USDC for LINK, the script approves the Aave Pool contract to spend the user's LINK.
   - The script then deposits the LINK tokens into Aave, enabling the user to earn interest on the deposited LINK.

This integration exemplifies the composability of DeFi protocols, allowing users to seamlessly transition from a token swap on Uniswap to earning yield on Aave with minimal interaction.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git




2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your RPC URL and private key:
   ```bash
   RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
   PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
   ```

4. Run the script to execute the token swap and deposit the LINK tokens into Aave:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
